## The Promise of Machine Learning in Education

- Educators are facing a work environment that is increasingly complex, data 
rich, and time/labor intensive
- Performance measures, accountability pressure, and a desire to understand 
student progression have created a proliferation of data
- Many schools and school districts are unable to devote resources to data analysis
- Data is collected, stored, and reported -- but often not able to be used to 
assist educators

**This is the promise**

## Setting the Context

- Background on DEWS
- Based on experience of deploying a machine learning application to all school 
districts in the state of Wisconsin
- Focus on the challenges of successful implementation and deployment unique to 
this government context

## About DEWS

- DEWS is the Wisconsin Dropout Early Warning System
- DEWS 

## What do we want from an EWS?
- **Early** identification in time to make interventions
- **Accurately** identifying students who need assistance and those who do not
- **Transparency** in how predictions were made and how students are labeled
- **Reproducibility** in the predictions so they vary with changes in underlying behaviors 
not the models
- **Scaleable** to a diverse array of student and school contexts

## What is out there? {.flexbox .vcenter}

<small>Adapted from Bowers, Sprott, and Taff 2013</small> 

```{r ewslitplot, fig.align='center', fig.height=7, fig.width=9.5}
library(png)
library(grid)
img <- readPNG("img/ewsLITplot2.png")
grid.raster(img, interpolate = TRUE)
```


## What is DEWS? {.smaller}

DEWS is an applied statistical model that combines several major features:

>- Data import, filtering, and cleaning for analysis from the state longitudinal 
database
>- A machine learning algorithm to search for the best predictive model
>- A prediction routine to apply models to current students
>- An exporting feature to push predictions into the state business intelligence 
tool, WISEdash for Districts
>- A display layer available to schools and districts securely for exploring the results
>- In reality, it resembles **software** as much as a statistical analysis


## Under the Hood of DEWS {.smaller}

DEWS consists of several sub-routines that can be thought of as states of building 
a statistical model

1. Data acquisition
2. Data cleaning, normalizing, and standardizing
3. Model feature and model algorithm search
4. Model testing
5. Model selection
6. New case scoring
7. Prediction export for reporting

All modules are built in the free and open source statistical computing language, [R](http://www.r-project.org/). 

## DEWS by the Numbers .{smaller}
- Analyzes over **350,000** historical records of student graduation
- Provides predictions on over **240,000** current students, in four grades, in the state
- Produces predictions on students in over **1,000** schools
- Selects from over **50** candidate statistical models **per grade**
- Hundreds of users have accessed thousands of individual student reports across 
nearly every Wisconsin school district
- Open sourced


## The DEWS Workflow

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.height=7, fig.width=9.5}
library(png)
library(grid)
img <- readPNG("img/DEWS_workflow_diagram.png")
grid.raster(img)
# <div style="width:300px; height:200px; align:center">
# ![DEWS Workflow](img/DEWS_workflow_diagram.png)
# </div>
```


## Why accuracy? 

**Opportunity cost**

>- Accuracy matters tremendously at scale. 
>- 1,000 schools receiving on average 240 predictions each. 
>- Each prediction reviewed by 3-5 staff for ~5 minutes
>- 3 x 240 x $\frac{1}{12}$ = 60 hours
>- 5 x 240 x $\frac{1}{12}$ = 100 hours
>- Across 1,000 schools thats 60,000 to 100,000 hours of work 
>- This could cost from $1 million to $4 million annually


## How did DEWS get done?

- Identify the problem
- Assemble a team
- Demo your product
- Iterate
- Deploy

## Identification

> It's better to solve the right problem approximately than to solve the 
> wrong problem exactly 

~ John Tukey

## Strategies for Identification

- Find policy relevant project

## Assemble

## Demo

## Iterate

## Data and School Completion

1. Student dropout is a phenomenon that has roots much earlier in the education 
pipeline than high school. 

2. Current early identification strategies are of unknown accuracy, difficult 
to implement, and rely on late breaking data. 

3. The predictors of dropout vary across jurisdictions, making one size fits 
all models inefficient, biased, or both. 

4. Teachers, counselors, principals, and other school staff are spending valuable 
time assessing student dropout likelihood using manual identification. 

**Early warning systems promise to reduce this burden and increase accuracy.**
